  format: DateFormat.dMMy,
  language: Lang.en,
  onChanged: (date) => print('Selected: $date'),
)

// Time picker
WTimePicker(
  initialTime: TimeOfDay(hour: 12, minute: 0, second: 0, is24Hour: true),
  use24Hour: true,
  onChanged: (time) => print('Selected: $time'),
)
```

#### Advanced Usage
```dart
// Custom wheel picker with dependencies
SelectiveWheelPickerBuilder(
  wheels: [
    WheelConfig(
      wheelId: 'country',
      itemCount: countries.length,
      formatter: (index) => countries[index].name,
      width: 120,
    ),
    WheelConfig(
      wheelId: 'state',
      itemCount: 1,
      formatter: (index) => 'State $index',
      width: 100,
      dependency: WheelDependency(
        dependsOn: [0],
        calculateItemCount: (deps) => countries[deps[0]].states.length,
        buildFormatter: (deps) => (index) => countries[deps[0]].states[index].name,
      ),
    ),
  ],
  onChanged: (indices) => print('Selected: $indices'),
)
```
